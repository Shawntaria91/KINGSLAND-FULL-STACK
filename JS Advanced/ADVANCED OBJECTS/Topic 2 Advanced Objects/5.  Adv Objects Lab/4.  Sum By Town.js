// 4. Sum by Town
// Youâ€™re tasked with calculating the total sum of income for a number of Towns. You will receive an array of strings representing towns and their incomes. Every even index will be a town and every odd index will be an income belonging to that town. 
// Create an object that will hold all the towns as keys and their total income (the sum of their //incomes) as values to those keys and print it as a JSON.
// Input
// The input comes as an array of strings - each even index is the name of a town and each odd index is an income belonging to that town.
// Output
// The output should be printed on the console - JSON representation of the object containing all towns and their total incomes.
