// Write a function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subsequence. In other
// words, you start from the first element and continue to the end of the given array of numbers. Any
// number which is LESS THAN the current biggest one is ignored, alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher than the
// current biggest one you set it as the current biggest one and you continue to the next number.
// The input comes as an array of numbers.
// The output is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing subsequence.
// Each element should be printed on a new line.
