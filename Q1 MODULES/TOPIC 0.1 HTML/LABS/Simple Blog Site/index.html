        <h1>Cats</h1>

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat">wildcat</a>.
            It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23-25 cm (9-10 in) in
            height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females. Adult
            domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 11 lb).

        <h2>Senses</h2>
        <p>
            Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required
            for human vision.[60]:43 This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum,
            which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby
            increasing the eye's senitivity to dim light.[70] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light.
            The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic
            aberration.[71] At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surfaces of its
            eyes.[72] However, the domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells,
            optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and
            green is limited.[73] A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might
            be due to a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather
            than representing true trichromatic vision.
